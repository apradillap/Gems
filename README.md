The **basic setup** is for authoring presentations only. The **full setup** gives you access to all gem features and plugins such as speaker notes as well as the development tasks needed to make changes to the source.


### Basic setup

The core of gems is very easy to install. You'll simply need to download a copy of this repository and open the index.html file directly in your browser.

1. Download the latest version of gems from <https://github.com/apradillap/gems/releases>

2. Unzip and replace the example contents in index.html with your own

3. Open index.html in a browser to view it

   $ git clone https://github.com/apradillap/gems.git
   ```

   ```

7. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
   ```sh
   $ grunt serve
   ```
